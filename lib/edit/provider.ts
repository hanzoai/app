/**
 * The `GitProvider` abstraction for Hanzo Edit — ONE interface every forge
 * (GitHub, GitLab, git.hanzo.ai/Gitea) implements, so the fork→edit→PR flow
 * (`lib/edit/flow.ts`) is written ONCE against this shape and each forge is a
 * drop-in. A page declares its forge via `<meta name="hanzo:provider">` (default
 * `github`); `providerFor(name, token)` binds the acting identity's token to a
 * concrete driver.
 *
 * PURE with respect to the runtime: the resolved provider token is passed to the
 * constructor (the route resolves it SERVER-SIDE via IAM — see `lib/edit/token.ts`
 * — so it never reaches the browser), and the global `fetch` is used, so every
 * driver is unit-testable by mocking `fetch`. Errors are the shared, typed
 * `GitSyncError` (carries the HTTP status the route maps through). Fail-closed.
